# Introduction #

Ops Scorecard is truly in its earliest stages of development. We really want to see its evolution driven by its user base so we have only focussed on showing off concepts at this stage.


Here are the goals for the first milestone.
  * Demo and get feedback to drive data model
  * Discern the reporting structure
  * Identify integration points

Here are some obvious gaps that need to be filled in subsequent milestones:
  * Optimized UI to decrease the amount of page jumps
  * Authorization scheme to control user management
  * External tool integration (probably with ticketing systems)
